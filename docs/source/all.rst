Introduction to EnGene
======================

This is a manual for the EnGene module which is currently employed to identify common and context-specific essential genes (EG) from gene deletion experimetnal scores, such as experimental scores downloaded from the DepMap porta from CRISPR-Ca9 or RNA-i experiments.

Theoretical Background 
######################

When analysing data from CRISPR-Cas9 screens in functional and translational studies another major computational problem is to classify and distinguish genetic dependencies involved in normal essential biological processes from disease- and genomic-context-specific vulnerabilities. Identifying context-specific essential genes, and distinguishing them from constitutively essential genes shared across all tissues and cells, i.e. common or core-essential genes (cEG), is also crucial for elucidating the mechanisms involved in tissue-specific diseases. In this prospective, focusing on very well-defined genomic contexts in tumours allows identifying cancer synthetic lethalities that could be exploited therapeutically.

Gene dependency profiles, generated via pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screening across large panels of human cancer cell lines, are becoming increasingly available. However, identifying and discriminating CFGs and context-specific essential genes (csEG) from this type of functional genetics screens remains not trivial.

To this end, EnGene aims to identify EG for common and specifci tissues offering the possibility to discover novel possible cancer-related targes.
Installation
============

The EnGene software can be directly download from the `GitHub page <https://github.com/emanuelefalbo/EnGene>`_ by using the git. The following steps briefly guides you to the use of git: for furher information follow `this link <https://www.atlassian.com/git>`_ .   

**1.** If you're using the https option, you can copy the EnGene version from the GitHub page to your local path: ::

    git clone https://github.com/emanuelefalbo/EnGene.git 


.. note::
    Cloning with SSH can be done if a SSH protected-key has been added to your GitHub profile. 

Done! You have the current version of EnGene downloaded locally.


Requirements
############

The EnGene software runs with the python3 language. The following packages are required for the correct behaviour of EnGene: 

#. numpy
#. pandas
#. argparse
#. sklearn
#. kneed
#. matplotlib
#. seaborn
#. sklearn_extra

Pip or Conda 
############

The above packages can be installed by pip as: ::

    pip install numpy pandas argparse scikit-learn scikit-learn-extra seaborn matplotlib kneed 

The above libraries might give generate some conflicts for future configuration of the program. 
In that case, a conda environment is suggested. To install conda locally you can follow this `conda link <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html>`__ . Once conda is installed, it will be added automatically to your PATH (.bashrc or .bash_profile) which  sligthly slows your prompt ; this can be seen at prompt of the terminal like follows:
 
.. image:: images/cml.png
  :width: 400

This will activate the base environment every time a terminal is open. However, to avoid this you can create a file name **.condarc** and insert this line **auto_activate_base: false**

Then, the following steps can be followed for settting up properly conda. 

**1.** Create an environment as follows: ::

    conda create -n myenv 

you can list the environment by executing: ::

   conda env list

**2.** Activate your environment: ::
  
   conda activate myenv

**3.** Install all the above packages: ::

   conda install numpy pandas   

However, some libraries, such as scikit-learn and kneed, are not present in common searching channels of conda, therefore, these can be installed from different channels: ::

  conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib scikit-learn scikit-learn-extra seaborn argparse 

.. note::
    The installation of these packages my require some time, beacuse conda is clever enough to check conflicts and compatibility between libraries versions. 

.. warning::
    When working in conda envirnoment it is preferable to install packages with conda such as shown here, and **NOT** with pip, which might cause conflicts. 

Get Started with EnGene
=======================

This session gives suggestions about setting up an input file for the execution of EnGene.

Manual Page
###########

The input files for EnGene are data file (tsv or txt) from  gene deletion experimental scores downloaded from the DepMap portal (e.g. depmap_scores.csv), reference selector cell lines, as well as genomic characterization data from the CCLE project. These can be download from  `DepMap portal <https://depmap.org/portal/download/all/>`_ . 

The help message of python is as follow: ::

   home:$ python EnGene.py -h  
   usage: EnGene.py [-h] -i INPUT -ref REFERENCE -t TISSUE [-m {drop,impute}] [-n N] [-k {centroids,medoids,both}]
   
   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -m {drop,impute}      choose to drop Nan or impute
     -n N                  Number of clusters for clustering algorithms
     -k {centroids,medoids,both}
                           choose between KMeans and K-medoids clustering algorithms or both
   
   required named arguments:
     -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                           Input file CRISPR-Cas9 matrix
     -ref REFERENCE, --reference REFERENCE
                           Input reference file name
     -t TISSUE, --tissue TISSUE
                           Input tissue to be parsed; all cell lines are employed if == all


The input file is the CRISPR-Cas9 matrix downloaded from the DepMap above website, and consist of n genes on the rows and m cell lines on the columsn, while the -ref option refers to a so-called reference file which contain information about the cell lines belonging to specific tissues. This file is fundamental to screen all tissue-specific cell lines from the CRISPR scores matrix. An exmaple of **REFERENCE** file is provided in the example folder of github page. This file can be downloaded from `DepMap portal <https://depmap.org/portal/download/all/>`_ by selecting Tools option and then pressing *Create custom list* and sleecting all tissues. After saving the list, the file will be downloaded. 

.. note::
    The file CRISPRGeneEffect.csv contains the knockout screens scores for all tissue cell lines. 
    The reference file must contain the column "lineage1" with information on specific tissue.

.. warning::
    Continuous updates are added to the portal, thus, it is always suggested to employ the latest data set. 

Imputing or dropping NaN
########################

The CRISPR matrix might contain NaN which interefre with correct fucntioning of clustering algorithsm. NaN  are handled by dropping all cell lines containing NaN or by imputing them with a k-nereast-neighbour algorithm (KNN, with k = 5 ) 

K-means vs K-Medoid
###################

Two unsupervised algorithm, i.e, KMeans or KMedoid, can be chosen by the user to cluster the CRISPR matrix and assign labels to genes. While KMeans tries to minimize the within cluster sum-of-squares, KMedoids tries to minimize the sum of distances between each point and the medoid of its cluster. The medoid is a data point (unlike the centroid) which has the least total distance to the other members of its cluster.

If a binary identification is carried out, i.e. by giving -n 2,  two classes corresponding to EG and not-essential genes (NEG) are calculated.

 .. note::
     Further analysis on more clusters has not been largely tested. 

EnGene firstly performs a clustering on the full CRISPR matrix returning the common EG (cEG) and NEG to all cell lines , and the after having removed possible outliers with IQR method, it computes the EG and NEG spefic for each tissue. The output of the full matrix is reported in an file named **Clusters_AllTissues_DepMap.csv**, while for each tissue the files are names **cluster_{tissue}.csv**

 .. warning::
    Thes files must not be renamed since are used internally to compute context-specific EG  

Afterwards, the module computes the csEG for the tissue indicated by the **-t** option, subctracting from the cEG from the EG of the selected tissue.


Removal of Outliners by IQR
###########################

A further processing on the cell lines of each tissue is executed by applying the interquartile range approach to detect and remove possible outliers from the sub-matrices of each tissue. The interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion, and it is defined as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the data. To calculate the IQR, the data set is divided into quartiles, or four rank-ordered even parts via linear interpolation These quartiles are denoted by Q1 (also called the lower quartile), Q2 (the median), and Q3 (also called the upper quartile). The lower quartile corresponds with the 25th percentile and the upper quartile corresponds with the 75th percentile, so IQR = Q3 âˆ’  Q1[1]. The cell lines with a IQR value out the the third and first quartile are removed from the sub-matrices.

Submission in Local 
###################

For example, the submission of a EnGene requires two input files and the tissue(s) to be investigated. For example, it can be executed in local as follows: ::

    python EnGene.py -i CRISPRGeneEffect.csv -ref cell-line-selector.csv -t Bone -m impute -n 2 -k centroids  

where the **CRISPRGeneEffect.csv** containes the CRISPR-Cas9 scores, while **cell-line-selector.csv** the cell lines corresponding to the lineages/tissues chosen. The EnGene software returns as main output a **output_bone.csv** file containing the label for each gene of the chosen tissue(s), computed by the chosen algorithm. EnGene searches for the cell lines in the CRISPRGeneEffect.csv by matching them with those from the selected tissue(s) form cell-line-selector.csv file. 

.. note::
    Currently, only one tissue can be selected. In future, multiple choices will be added.

Handling NaN
------------

EnGene handles possible NaN values in input data by performing a complete removal of all cell lines(columns) containing NaN (-m drop) or 
by executing an imputation using the `k-nearest neighbour algorithm <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.KNNImputer.html>`_. 

Computing cEG and csEG
----------------------

The program firstly perform the clustering on the full DepMap matrix, outputting its results into the file : **Clusters_AllTissues_DepMap.csv**. Then, each tissue is processed and their results are outputted in the files name **cluster_{tissue}.csv**, which contain the cEG per tissue.  Finally, the csEG are calculated by subtracting the cEG per tissue from the cEG obtained from the DepMap full matrix.
