Introduction to EnGene
======================

This is a manual for the EnGene module which is currently employed to identify common and context-specific essential genes (EG) from gene deletion experimetnal scores, such as thso from CRISPR-Ca9 or RNA-i experiments.

Theoretical Background

When analysing data from CRISPR-Cas9 screens in functional and translational studies another major computational problem is to classify and distinguish genetic dependencies involved in normal essential biological processes from disease- and genomic-context-specific vulnerabilities. Identifying context-specific essential genes, and distinguishing them from constitutively essential genes shared across all tissues and cells, i.e. common or core-essential genes (cEG), is also crucial for elucidating the mechanisms involved in tissue-specific diseases. In this prospective, focusing on very well-defined genomic contexts in tumours allows identifying cancer synthetic lethalities that could be exploited therapeutically.

Gene dependency profiles, generated via pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screening across large panels of human cancer cell lines, are becoming increasingly available. However, identifying and discriminating CFGs and context-specific essential genes (csEG) from this type of functional genetics screens remains not trivial.

To this end, EnGene aims to identify EG for common and specifci tissues offering the possibility to discover novel possible cancer-related targes.
