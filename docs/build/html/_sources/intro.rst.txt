Introduction to EnGene
======================

This is a manual for the EnGene software which is currently employed to analyse omics data, i.e. gene scores,  from distributed database

Theoretical Background

When analysing data from CRISPR-Cas9 screens in functional and translational studies another major computational problem is to classify and distinguish genetic dependencies involved in normal essential biological processes from disease- and genomic-context-specific vulnerabilities. Identifying context-specific essential genes, and distinguishing them from constitutively essential genes shared across all tissues and cells, i.e. core-fitness genes (CFGs), is also crucial for elucidating the mechanisms involved in tissue-specific diseases. In this prospective, focusing on very well-defined genomic contexts in tumours allows identifying cancer synthetic lethalities that could be exploited therapeutically.

Gene dependency profiles, generated via pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screening across large panels of human cancer cell lines, are becoming increasingly available. However, identifying and discriminating CFGs and context-specific essential genes (csEG) from this type of functional genetics screens remains not trivial.
